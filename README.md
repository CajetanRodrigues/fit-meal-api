` Note: I have hosted all of the APIs on Amazon EC2 Instance, and would keep it over there for a limited period of time. I would recommend  you to change the host from 0.0.0.0 to 127.0.0.1 and also change the database link, as I have restristed the database to my IP Address 
 and the IP Address of the Amazon EC2 Instance.`
